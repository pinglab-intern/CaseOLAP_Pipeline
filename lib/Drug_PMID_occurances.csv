we identified human clinical studies published through february 2005 involving biasp 30 in patients with type 2 diabetes by performing a medline search (key words: biphasic insulin aspart, biasp 30, biphasic insulin, and premixed insulin). additional papers were identified by assessing (1) the reference lists in these studies, (2) published conference proceedings, and (3) our reference files. a total of 21 relevant papers were retrieved: 13 were published as full manuscripts, 1 as a short communication, 5 as abstracts, and 1 as a poster. one paper is currently in press. novo nordisk supplied data from an unpublished trial (study 1536, 2004), as well as data from a trial published in abstract form only (study 1269, 2002).
a regimen of biasp 30 bid, at breakfast and dinner, provides improved ppg control compared with bhi 30 bid, nph bid, and insulin glargine od for patients with type 2 diabetes. fasting plasma glucose (fpg) with biasp 30 was not significantly different from fpg with insulin glargine; however, fpg was higher with biasp 30 than with nph. biasp 30 prevented excessive ppg excursions whether it was injected at the beginning of a meal or < or =15 minutes after starting a meal. biasp 30 was not associated with an increased risk of major hypoglycemia compared with other insulin regimens used in the studies reviewed. the incidence of minor hypoglycemic events with biasp 30 varied across studies but occurred with frequency or risk similar to bhi 30, mix 25, or nph. treat to target trials reported that biasp 30 can be used to intensify insulin therapy and to reach the glycemic target recommended by the american diabetes association (ie, hba1c <7.0%). one study reported a greater lowering of postprandial triglyceride levels with biasp 30 than with bhi 30.
biasp 30 bid can reduce ppg levels to a greater extent than other common treatment regimens, including basal insulin od. using biasp 30, even once daily, may allow some patients to reach glycemic targets with a degree of convenience and tolerability that may not be achievable with other treatment regimens.",Efficacy of biphasic insulin aspart in patients with type 2 diabetes.,Insulin aspart (NovoLog)

the aim of this review was to evaluate the safety profile associated with biasp 30 in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes versus that of comparator insulin products, including bhi 30 and biphasic insulin lispro 25 (mix 25 [25% biphasic insulin lispro and 75% protaminated lispro], humalog mix 75/25, eli lilly and company, indianapolis, indiana), together with the basal insulins, including nph insulin and insulin glargine (lantus, sanofi aventis pharmaceuticals, paris, france).
data from human clinical studies published in peer reviewed journals or as conference proceedings that reported safety results in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated with biasp 30 versus comparator insulins were evaluated. to locate the appropriate articles, a medline search was performed for all years up to february 2005, using the following key words: biphasic insulin aspart, biasp 30, biphasic insulin, and premixed insulin. additional papers were identified by examining the reference lists in these papers as well as our own personal reference files. results from 17 publications were analyzed. the analysis included >2600 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean [range] age, 58 [36 70] years; duration of diabetes, 11.8 [9 17] years; and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin [hba1c], 8.6% [7.5% 9.9%]). it also included 104 patients with type 1 diabetes (mean [range] age, 44.5 [30 58] years; duration of diabetes, 16 [2 30] years; and baseline hba1c, 8.4% [7.2% 10.4%]).
hypoglycemia occurred in 43% to 57% of patients receiving biasp 30 versus 32% to 57% of patients receiving bhi 30 and 28% of patients receiving nph insulin. major hypoglycemic events were uncommon in most studies; but when they did occur, they were reported less frequently in patients receiving biasp 30 (2% 8% of patients) than in patients receiving bhi 30 (2% 14% of patients). furthermore, patients treated with biasp 30 were at lower risk of experiencing minor nocturnal hypoglycemia than patients receiving comparator insulin; in 1 study, the relative risk (biasp 30 vs bhi 30) was calculated to be 0.63 (95% ci, 0.37 to 1.09). the adverse event (ae) profile, weight gain during treatment, and formation of cross reactive antibodies were not different between biasp 30 and bhi 30. aes were reported in 36% to 90% of patients receiving biasp 30, 38% to 88% of patients receiving bhi 30, and 51% of patients receiving mix 25. the use of oral antidiabetic drugs in combination with biasp 30 did not alter the safety profile of biasp 30.
the flexible and convenient treatment regimen offered by biasp 30, together with its ability to improve postprandial glucose control, is associated with a safety profile comparable to that of bhi 30 and nph insulin, with a lower risk of major and nocturnal hypoglycemic events.",Biphasic insulin aspart 30: literature review of adverse events associated with treatment.,Insulin aspart (NovoLog)

in mice, we examined insulin detemir's prolonged brain exposure by continuous subcutaneous (s.c.) application using either micro osmotic pumps or daily s.c. injections and performed continuous radiotelemetric electrocorticography and locomotion recordings.
acute intracerebroventricular injection of insulin detemir activated cortical and locomotor activity significantly more than regular insulin in equimolar doses (0.94 and 5.63 mu in total), suggesting an enhanced acute impact on brain networks. however, given continuously s.c., insulin detemir significantly reduced cortical activity (theta: 21.3±6.1% vs. 73.0±8.1%, p<0.001) and failed to maintain locomotion, while regular insulin resulted in an increase of both parameters.
the data suggest that permanently increased insulin detemir levels in the brain convert its hyperstimulatory effects and finally mediate impairments in brain activity and locomotion. this observation might be considered when human studies with insulin detemir are designed to target the brain in order to optimize treatment regimens.",Sustained Treatment with Insulin Detemir in Mice Alters Brain Activity and Locomotion.,Insulin detemir (Levemir)

outcomes included costs of treatment/management and costs (and incidence) of diabetes related complications. incremental cost effectiveness ratios (icers) were calculated from differences in total costs and quality adjusted life years (qalys).

findings provide evidence for the cost effectiveness of detemir vs. nph in treating t1 and t2dm in canada, and support the key role of assumptions regarding the impact of hypoglycemic events. additional work is needed to determine the extent to which results are robust for different sub groups of patients and for variation in assumptions around hba(1c) improvements and hypoglycemic event rates.",Cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Canadian payer setting: modeling analysis.,Insulin detemir (Levemir)

term human placentae from uncomplicated pregnancies were obtained immediately after delivery. insulin lispro, at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 micro u/ml, was introduced into the maternal reservoir. the maternal side of the placenta was perfused with constant concentration of lispro insulin; the fetal circulation was closed. samples were drawn from both the maternal and fetal circulations at regular intervals. the appearance of insulin lispro in the fetal circulation was analyzed by a specific radioimmunoassay.
no placental transfer of lispro could be detected during perfusion with 100 and 200 micro u/ml. in contrast, there was a small concentration dependent transfer to the fetus at concentrations of 580 micro u/ml and higher, detectable after at least an hour of constant concentration of insulin lispro during perfusion. the rate of placental transfer was 0.019 micro u x min( 1) x g tissue( 1) at maternal levels of 580 micro u/ml and 0.045 micro u x min( 1) x g( 1) tissue at maternal levels of 1000 micro u/ml. measuring lispro levels in 11 pregnant women revealed that a dose of 50 units may achieve serum concentrations >200 micro u/ml with apparent linear correlation between dose and levels.
insulin lispro is not likely to cross the placenta at a single standard dose. this study suggests that insulin lispro is unlikely to reach or harm the unborn baby.",Transfer of insulin lispro across the human placenta: in vitro perfusion studies.,Insulin lispro (Humalog)

ten subjects on csii were treated for 3 months with lispro and 3 months with regular insulin in a double blind randomized crossover study after 3 months of treatment with each insulin, hepatic sensitivity to glucagon was measured in each subject. the test consisted of a 4 h simultaneous infusion of somatostatin (450 microg/h) to suppress endogenous glucagon, regular insulin (0.15 mu x kg( 1) x min( 1)), glucose at a variable rate to maintain plasma glucose near 5 mmol/l, and d [6,6 2h2]glucose to measure hgp during the last 2 h, glucagon was infused at 1.5 ng x kg( 1) x min( 1). eight nondiabetic people served as control subjects.

a systematic literature review using pubmed and the medical subject headings (mesh) terms ""hyperglycemia,"" ""enteral nutrition,"" and ""parenteral nutrition"" were used to evaluate the current evidence available for treating noncritically ill patients with hyperglycemia who were receiving artificial nutrition.
the literature review showed that few randomized control trials exist regarding treatment of hyperglycemia in this cohort of patients, and the multiple retrospective evaluations that have addressed this topic provided varied results. in general, intravenous (iv) continuous insulin infusion offers the best glycemic control; however, this route of insulin administration is often burdensome for floor patients and their care teams. administration of scheduled subcutaneous (sq) insulin in patients on ent or pnt is a safe and effective way to manage hyperglycemia, however limited data exist on an appropriate insulin regimen.
further prospective, randomized control trials are necessary to determine the optimal treatment of hyperglycemia for patients receiving ent or pnt.

studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials in adults with diabetes mellitus type 2 and had a trial duration of at least 24 weeks.
two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. pooling of studies by means of random effects meta analyses was performed.
six studies comparing insulin glargine to nph (neutral protamine hagedorn) insulin and two studies comparing insulin detemir to nph insulin were identified. in these trials, 1715 patients were randomised to insulin glargine and 578 patients to insulin detemir. duration of the included trials ranged from 24 to 52 weeks. metabolic control, measured by glycosylated haemoglobin a1c (hba1c) as a surrogate endpoint, and adverse effects did not differ in a clinical relevant way between treatment groups. while no statistically significant difference for severe hypoglycaemia rates was shown in any of the trials, the rate of symptomatic, overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly lower in patients treated with either insulin glargine or detemir. no evidence for a beneficial effect of long acting analogues on patient oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, quality of life or costs could be obtained.

sitagliptin may predominantly act on fpg, whereas mitiglinide may act on postprandial plasma glucose to achieve glycemic control after switching from a bolus insulin regimen. additional therapy to sitagliptin or mitiglinide is clearly required to obtain equivalent glycemic control in patients using a higher dose of insulin.

similar hba1c reduction was observed when sitagliptin or sulphonylureas were added to metformin in older and younger age groups. sitagliptin use led to modest comparative weight loss. there may be greater risk of over treatment with sulphonylureas evidenced by greater proportion recording hba1c < 48 mmol/mol by study end. this evidence supporting use of sitagliptin when add on therapy is selected in older adults should be considered alongside the wider evidence base and patient preference.",Comparative effectiveness of sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas in older people.,Sitagliptin

rats were treated with amiodarone alone (500 mg/kg body weight per day) or together with antioxidants (silibinin or mtdq da: 50 mg/kg body weight per day) or with either antioxidant alone. they received amiodarone for 30 days and antioxidant for 33 days (3 days pretreatment). in vitro, amiodarone induced a dose dependent chemiluminescence signal, which was inhibited by the two dihydroquinolin type antioxidants (mtdq da, ch 402). chemiluminometric results from liver homogenate demonstrated that simultaneous treatment with silibinin partially prevented the liver homogenate superoxide anion radical scavenger capacity decreasing effect of amiodarone. amiodarone treatment caused a significant increase of nadph and fe3+ induced lipid peroxidation in the liver microsomal fraction, which antioxidants (silibinin, mtdq da) were unable to prevent. light microscopy of the lung tissue in amiodarone treated rats showed accumulation of foamy macrophages with thickening of the interalveolar septa, pneumonitis, and variable interstitial fibrosis. antioxidant treatment did not prevent these changes. electron micrographs of lung from amiodarone treated rats showed lysosomal phospholipoidosis, intralysosomal electron dense deposits, and increased lysosome number and size. in contrast to rats treated with amiodarone alone, those treated with both amiodarone and silibinin had significantly fewer lysosomes (p < 0.01); the lysosome size, shape, and internal characteristics remained the same. simultaneous treatment with silibinin and amiodarone decreased lysosomal phospholipoidosis compared to amiodarone treatment alone. simultaneous treatment with mtdq da and amiodarone did not show any beneficial effect. pulse radiolysis and cobalt 60 gamma (60co gamma) radiolysis studies showed that the main free radical product in a reducing environment was a very reactive aryl radical formed after the partial deiodination of the amiodarone molecule. the radiosensitizing effect of amiodarone was also verified in rat liver microsomal preparations using in vivo amiodarone with or without mtdq da pretreatment and 60co gamma irradiation with or without the in vitro addition of antioxidants (ch 402, mtdq da). in vivo, the mtdq da treatment also had a radiosensitizing effect; however, the in vitro addition of both antioxidants resulted in a radioprotective effect. the aryl radical also may emerge in vivo during the metabolism of amiodarone.
these observations suggest that amiodarone in vitro and in vivo generates free radicals that may play a role in the pathogenesis of amiodarone toxicity beside other well established mechanisms, and antioxidants may have a partial protective effect against amiodarone toxicity.",The role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of amiodarone toxicity.,amiodarone

thirty two healthy volunteers, eight subjects in four parallel groups, ingested 10 mg of amlodipine on an empty stomach. activated charcoal (25 g in 300 ml of water) was ingested either immediately afterwards or 2 h or 6 h after amlodipine, or amlodipine was ingested with 300 ml of water only (control). plasma concentrations and the cumulative excretion of amlodipine into urine were measured by gc ms for 96 h and 72 h, respectively. in addition, adsorption of amlodipine to charcoal was studied in vitro.
activated charcoal administered immediately after amlodipine reduced the amlodipine auc(0.96 h) and the 72 h urinary excretion by 99% (p < 0.0005). after a delay of 2 h in charcoal administration the auc(0.96 h) was reduced by 49% (p = 0.001), but after a delay of 6 h the reduction was 15% only (p = ns). at a charcoal:drug ratio of 5:1, about 90% of amlodipine was adsorbed by charcoal in vitro; at ratios of 10:1 and 20:1, adsorption was practically complete.
activated charcoal almost completely prevented amlodipine absorption when administered immediately after amlodipine ingestion. charcoal also markedly reduced amlodipine absorption when given 2 h after amlodipine; in amlodipine overdose, administration of charcoal may be beneficial even later. we conclude that administration of activated charcoal is the method of choice to prevent absorption of amlodipine in amlodipine overdose.",Prevention of amlodipine absorption by activated charcoal: effect of delay in charcoal administration.,amlodipine

when amrinone is administered to children during cardiopulmonary bypass, about 20% of the dose becomes bound to the circuit. available drug is distributed within a smaller volume than predicted. this may be the consequence of the physiologic perturbations of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.","Amrinone loading during cardiopulmonary bypass in neonates, infants, and children.",amrinone

one hundred and four patients were enrolled and randomised after a run in period of at least 14 days on aspirin ec 75 mg (day 0), to receive either microencapsulated aspirin 162.5 mg (n=34), aspirin ec 150 mg (n=36) or continue on aspirin ec 75 mg (n=34) for 28 days. serum thromboxane b2 and collagen induced platelet aggregation and release of 5 hydroxytryptamine (ec50 values) were measured on days 0 and 28. aggregation/release ec50s were then repeated in the presence of a large dose of aspirin added in vitro to determine the ec50 at the maximum level of platelet inhibition.

total duration of exercise was not increased by any treatment. exercise time to the development of 1 mm st segment depression was not significantly changed with benazepril alone or in combination with nifedipine but was increased with nifedipine from 4.18 (1.8) min to 4.99 (1.6) min (95% confidence interval (95% ci) 0.28 to 1.34; p < 0.05). there was a significant relation between increase in duration of exercise and resting renin concentration (r = 0.498; p < 0.01). myocardial ischaemia during daily activity, as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was reduced by benazepril and by the benazepril and nifedipine combination. this was significant for total ischaemic burden (451(628) min v 231(408) min; 95% ci  398 to  41 min; p < 0.05) and maximal depth of st segment depression ( 2.47(1.2) mm v  2.16 mm; 95% ci 0.04 to 0.57; p < 0.05) for the combination and for maximal st segment depth for benazepril monotherapy ( 2.47 (1.2) mm v  1.96(1.2) mm; 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91; p < 0.05). benazepril significantly altered the circadian rhythm of cardiac ischaemia, abolishing the peak ischaemic periods at 0700 to 1200 and 1700 to 2300 (p < 0.05).
benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, had a modest anti ischaemic effect in effort angina, but this effect was not as pronounced as with nifedipine. the anti ischaemic action was more noticeable in asymptomatic ischaemia during daily activity, whereas nifedipine had little effect on this aspect of myocardial ischaemia. the combination of benazepril and nifedipine reduced ischaemia of daily activity.",Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in chronic stable angina: effects on myocardial ischaemia and comparison with nifedipine.,benazepril

endotoxin infusion reduced cardiac index and systemic oxygen delivery; bosentan restored these parameters. the reduced mean arterial blood pressure and renal blood flow remained unaffected by bosentan. the profound reduction in gut oxygen delivery in response to endotoxin was completely abolished by bosentan. bosentan significantly improved the notably deteriorated intestinal mucosal ph and mucosal arterial pco2 gap. the mucosal portal vein pco2 gap, used to monitor the mucosa in relation to the gut as a whole (including the spleen and pancreas), was also greatly increased by endotoxaemia and significantly reversed by bosentan.
bosentan completely restored the profound endotoxin induced reductions in systemic and gut oxygen delivery with a concomitant reversal of intestinal mucosal acidosis. results suggest that endothelin is involved in the pronounced perfusion disturbances seen in the gut in endotoxic shock. bosentan may prove useful in reducing gut ischaemia in septic shock.",The endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan restores gut oxygen delivery and reverses intestinal mucosal acidosis in porcine endotoxin shock.,bosentan

the incidence of severe myalgia with iv furosemide infusion was assessed to measure confounding by indication bias. electronic medical records were used to identify patients exposed to bumetanide 0.25 mg/ml or furosemide 2 mg/ml continuous iv infusions. we defined severe myalgia as a diffuse myalgia with a physician's documented suspicion of bumetanide  or furosemide induced myalgia unresponsive to electrolyte repletion and necessitating a change to alternative diuretics. the incidence of severe myalgia during bumetanide therapy was 5.8%, with the incidence increasing with higher bumetanide infusion rates: 2.6% for an infusion rate ≤ 1 mg/hour and 10.3% for a rate > 1 mg/hour (p=0.0005). in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a bumetanide infusion rate > 1 mg/hour was independently associated (odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.94 12.02, p=0.0007) with severe myalgia compared to that with a rate ≤ 1 mg/hour. no patients receiving furosemide continuous iv infusion experienced severe myalgia, although infusion rates were lower in potency than bumetanide infusion rates.
the incidence of severe myalgia in patients with ahf receiving bumetanide infusion was 5.8%, 29 fold higher than incidence rate listed in the package labeling. patients receiving infusion rates > 1 mg/hour were 4 fold more likely to experience bumetanide induced severe myalgia than those receiving rates ≤ 1 mg/hour.",Evaluation of Severe Myalgia Induced by Continuous-Infusion Bumetanide in Patients with Acute Heart Failure.,bumetanide

this article reviews the efficacy, tolerability and safety of colesevelam in clinical practice. the literature search was based on a pubmed search up to january 2008.
colesevelam, used alone or in combination with other hypolipidaemic agents (statins, ezetimibe and fenofibrate), has an overall favourable effect on lipid profile. specifically, colesevelam reduces total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl c) and apolipoprotein b levels and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein ai. however, colesevelam may slightly raise triglyceride levels. colesevelam can improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients. moreover, it may have anti inflammatory properties, as it can reduce high sensitivity c reactive protein concentration. colesevelam almost lacks the intense side effects of previously used bass, thus resulting in better patient compliance. however, the dose regimen consisting of up to 7 tablets/day and high cost may limit its use.
colesevelam is a safe alternative for those intolerant to other lipid lowering medication. this bas also provides an option for patients who do not reach their ldl c goal despite treatment with a statin.",Colesevelam hydrochloride in clinical practice: a new approach in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.,colesevelam

blood samples from 12 healthy volunteers were spiked in vitro with 0 5000 ng/ml of dabigatran. dabigatran reversal was evaluated by adding 1000 μg/ml of idarucizumab (praxbind) to dabigatran spiked samples, which reflect the administration of 5 g idarucizumab to a 70 kg patient. residual dabigatran activity was assessed using the calibrated automated tg (thrombinoscope) in platelet poor plasma samples. the tg results were compared with wb aptt (drihemato aptt s) and pt (drihemato pt s) using cg02n analyzer, thromboelastometry (rotem) triggered by ellagic acid (intem) and tissue factor (extem).
at a therapeutic concentration of dabigatran (200 ng/ml), the lag time was prolonged, and peak tg was decreased. the effects of dabigatran on tg were increased up to 1000 ng/ml, and tg was obliterated at higher supratherapeutic dabigatran levels (p < .001 versus control, respectively). tg was fully restored with idarucizumab when dabigatran was ≤2000 ng/ml, but residual anticoagulant activity was observed at higher dabigatran levels. dabigatran prolonged wb aptt and pt concentration dependently, and residual prolongations were observed when idarucizumab was added to 3000 or 5000 ng/ml of dabigatran (p < .001 versus control, respectively). in contrast, both intem and extem clotting times were reversed toward reference ranges at all dabigatran concentrations when idarucizumab was added.
our data indicate that the recommended dose of idarucizumab may not restore tg completely with excessively elevated concentrations of dabigatran. all wb measurements with aptt, pt, and thromboelastometry predicted supratherapeutic dabigatran concentrations, whereas those tests varied in sensitivity to residual anticoagulant activity after reversal. wb aptt corresponded well with plasma tg changes among those measurements, but the use of thromboelastometry may overestimate the effect of idarucizumab. caution should be exercised before extrapolating in vitro point of care data to the clinical monitoring of dabigatran reversal.",Whole Blood Point-of-Care Testing for Incomplete Reversal With Idarucizumab in Supratherapeutic Dabigatran.,dabigatran

in addition to antiplatelet activity, dipyridamole also inhibits cell proliferation. we examined whether the antiproliferative action of dipyridamole on smooth muscle cells, as demonstrated here, has a direct effect on intimal thickening after vascular injury.
cell proliferation was determined by measuring deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) synthesis and by cell counting. the in vivo effect of locally delivered dipyridamole was determined in a rabbit model with carotid or femoral artery injury.
dipyridamole produced a dose dependent inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, producing 50% inhibition at 7 micrograms/ml. structural analogues sh 869 and mopamidol were 10 to 100 times less effective than dipyridamole, suggesting that cell growth inhibition may be unrelated to the antiplatelet activity of dipyridamole. inhibition of cell proliferation by dipyridamole was attenuated by increasing the serum concentration in the culture medium. bypassing serum by local delivery of dipyridamole at the periadventitial site produced 63% inhibition (p < 0.05) of cell replication in balloon injured arteries. locally delivered dipyridamole also inhibited intimal thickening (20%, p < 0.05) after balloon injury.
dipyridamole inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro. this activity was attenuated by serum proteins. locally delivered dipyridamole inhibited cell replication in arteries and intimal thickening after balloon injury. these results suggest that although systemic treatment with dipyridamole may not be efficacious because of inadequate serum levels, its antiproliferative action on smooth muscle cells may reduce restenosis when the drug is delivered locally after coronary angioplasty.",Dipyridamole directly inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo: implications in the treatment of restenosis after angioplasty.,dipyridamole

solutions of dipyridamole were illuminated in the presence of tetrasulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (alpcs(4)) and dimethylmethylene blue (dmmb). solutions of amino acids, rbcs, and vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) in rbc suspensions were photodynamically treated in the presence or absence of dipyridamole.
illumination of a solution of dipyridamole in the presence of alpcs(4) or dmmb resulted in changes in the optical spectrum of dipyridamole. the photooxidation of dipyridamole was inhibited by azide and augmented by d(2)o, which suggests the involvement of singlet oxygen. photooxidation of amino acids and photodamage to rbcs was strongly reduced in the presence of dipyridamole. in contrast, photoinactivation of vsv in rbc suspensions was only slightly affected by dipyridamole.

in each of 13 healthy subjects, cbf was measured using (15)o labeled water and pet at rest and during hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and dipyridamole stress; corresponding cbf values were then compared.
cbf values during dipyridamole stress were significantly lower than those measured at rest. the dipyridamole stress paco(2) was also significantly lower than the resting paco(2). the change in cbf during dipyridamole stress relative to paco(2) closely followed the relationship between cbf and paco(2) during hypocapnia.
these results indicate that the observed decrease in cbf during dipyridamole stress was caused by a decrease in paco(2) rather than by any direct action of dipyridamole on cbf. the decrease in paco(2) during dipyridamole stress was most likely due to hyperventilation, which was a side effect of adenosine. these results support the hypothesis that circulating adenosine is largely prevented from binding to adenosine receptors of cerebral vessels by the blood brain barrier.",Effect of intravenous dipyridamole on cerebral blood flow in humans.

these results suggest that cimetidine increased dofetilide exposure by inhibiting renal tubular dofetilide secretion, whereas ranitidine did not. this effect is not an h2 receptor antagonist class effect but is specific to cimetidine. if therapy with an h2 receptor antagonist is required, it is recommended that cimetidine at all doses be avoided; since ranitidine has no effect on dofetilide pharmacokinetics or prolongation of the qtc interval, it can be seen as a suitable alternative.",Effect of cimetidine and ranitidine on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of dofetilide.,dofetilide

in the evaluation of satisfaction with edoxaban od tablets, 52.8% of the patients perceived ""no difference"" from the existing edoxaban film coated tablets and 34.9% indicated that they were more satisfied with the od tablets, thus demonstrating a relatively high degree of satisfaction. when asked about convenience and reliability in using edoxaban od tablets, about half of the patients perceived ""no difference"" from the existing edoxaban film coated tablets and the remaining half indicated preference for the od tablets. responses about taste, flavor, ease of ingestion, and motivation to continue taking edoxaban indicated the overall acceptance of the od tablets. recognition of edoxaban od tablets was rated as ""easy"" by about half of the patients and ""difficult"" by the remaining half. among all patients, 49.5% preferred a change to edoxaban od tablets. the degree of satisfaction with taste, flavor, and ease of ingestion, as well as overall satisfaction, tended to be greater when the od tablets were taken with rather than without water, and the percentage of patients who preferred a change was higher in the group taking the od tablets with water.
this study indicated that the degree of satisfaction with taste, flavor, ease of ingestion, and convenience, as well as overall satisfaction, in addition to motivation to continue drug intake and sense of confidence were greater for od tablets than for the existing edoxaban film coated tablets. edoxaban od tablet is a promising formulation for inducing greater patient adherence to medication and therefore ensures better treatment response.

major or clinically relevant non major bleeding occurred in 6.7%, 3.4%, and 5.0% of patients in the miri edoxaban 30 mg, sri edoxaban 15 mg, and sri fondaparinux groups, respectively; there were no major bleeding events. no thromboembolic events occurred. at all time points assessed, edoxaban plasma concentrations and changes in coagulation biomarkers were similar between the sri and miri groups.
these results suggest edoxaban 15 mg once daily is well tolerated in japanese patients with sri undergoing llos.

the cast samples of pure enalapril maleate or eudragit e/enalapril maleate mixture after evaporating the solvent were prepared on an aluminum foil and also determined by reflectance fourier transform infrared (ftir) microspectroscopy equipped with thermal analyzer.
the result indicates that the interaction might occur between enalapril maleate and eudragit e in the solid state after evaporating the solvent. the thermal dependent ftir spectra show that not only the formation of dkp but also the six membered cyclic anhydride occurred in the enalapril maleate/eudragit e mixture in the heating process. two pathways for solid sate interaction were proposed. the stability of enalapril maleate was dependent on the weight ratio of enalapril maleate and eudragit e. the activation energy (n = 3) of dkp formation for pure enalapril maleate was about 141.2+/ 0.7 kj/mol, but it was reduced significantly to 86.7+/ 0.8 kj/mol after interaction with eudragit e (weight ratio: 1:1), suggesting eudragit e might exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. however, the degradation accelerated by eudragit e was reduced in high content of eudragit e.
when the weight ratio of both components was 1:1, eudragit e might interact with the carboxyl group of maleic acid to exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. however, the excess amount of eudragit e might somewhat reduce the degradation of enalapril, due to the interaction that occurred between eudragit e and carboxyl group of enalapril.",Eudragit E accelerated the diketopiperazine formation of enalapril maleate determined by thermal FTIR microspectroscopic technique.,enalapril

malignant hyperthermia trigger free general anesthesia was performed in mhs and mhn swine. skeletal muscle specimens were excised for an in vitro contracture test with 0.6 mm enoximone. thereafter, mhs and mhn swine were exposed to cumulative administration of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg enoximone intravenously. clinical occurrence of mh was defined by a pco(2) greater than 70 mmhg, a ph less than 7.20, and an increase in body temperature of more than 2.0 degrees c.
enoximone induced marked contractures in all mhs muscle specimens in vitro. in contrast, only small or no contracture development was observed in mhn muscle specimens, without an overlap in contractures between mhs and mhn muscles. however, in vivo, no clinical differences were found between mhs and mhn swine following cumulative enoximone doses. according to the defined criteria, none of the swine developed mh during the experiment. furthermore, high enoximone doses induced progressive circulatory insufficiency, and after receiving 32 mg/kg enoximone, all animals died of cardiovascular failure.

after the production of post countershock electromechanical dissociation, 25 animals received ten minutes of basic cpr and were randomized to receive cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine, high dose epinephrine, or standard dose epinephrine.
myocardial blood flow was measured using a colored microsphere technique at baseline, during basic cpr, and after intervention. immediate and two hour resuscitation rates were determined for each group. return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in eight of eight cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine compared with four of eight high dose epinephrine and three of eight standard dose epinephrine animals (p less than .04). one animal was resuscitated with cpr alone and was excluded. survival to two hours was achieved in five of eight cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine, four of eight high dose epinephrine, and three of eight standard dose epinephrine animals (ns). coronary perfusion pressure increased significantly in the cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine group when compared with the other groups (cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine, 76 +/  45 mm hg; high dose epinephrine, 24 +/  12 mm hg; standard dose epinephrine, 3 +/  14 mm hg; p less than .005). myocardial blood flow was higher in cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine and high dose epinephrine animals compared with standard dose epinephrine animals but did not reach statistical significance. cardiac output increased during cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine (p = .001) and standard dose epinephrine (ns) compared with basic cpr but decreased after epinephrine administration in the high dose epinephrine group (ns).
resuscitation from electromechanical dissociation was improved with cardiopulmonary bypass and epinephrine compared with high dose epinephrine or standard dose epinephrine alone. however, there was no difference in survival between groups. cardiopulmonary bypass with standard dose epinephrine resulted in higher cardiac output, coronary perfusion pressure, and a trend toward higher myocardial blood flow. a short period of cardiopulmonary bypass with epinephrine after prolonged post countershock electromechanical dissociation cardiac arrest can re establish sufficient circulation to effect successful early resuscitation.","Use of cardiopulmonary bypass, high-dose epinephrine, and standard-dose epinephrine in resuscitation from post-countershock electromechanical dissociation.",epinephrine

randomized blinded study performed in a controlled laboratory environment.
twenty mongrel dogs weighing 19.5 +/  4.6 kg.
all dogs received either iv epinephrine 0.015 mg/kg or intranasal epinephrine 14 mg per nostril. phentolamine (5 mg per nostril) was administered intranasally one minute before nasal administration of epinephrine to improve absorption. each dog underwent three minutes of ventricular fibrillation followed by seven minutes of cpr with a pneumatic chest compression device. epinephrine was administered at two minutes into cpr.
seven dogs were excluded because of inadequate baseline coronary perfusion pressure or compression device displacement, leaving a total of 13 dogs for analysis (six iv epinephrine, seven intranasal epinephrine). baseline coronary perfusion pressure (mean +/  sd) was similar for iv epinephrine and intranasal epinephrine (16.9 +/  7.1 mm hg versus 18.2 +/  13.8 mm hg, respectively, p = .84). for iv and intranasal epinephrine, coronary perfusion pressure increased to 21.4 +/  9.2 mm hg and 24.4 +/  18.7 mm hg one minute after epinephrine, respectively (p = .73). five minutes after epinephrine coronary perfusion pressure was 18.2 +/  8.7 mm hg and 24.3 +/  13.9 mm hg for iv epinephrine and intranasal epinephrine, respectively (p = .38). the rate of successful resuscitation was similar for both groups, five of seven dogs for intranasal epinephrine and four of six dogs for iv epinephrine (p = .66).
intranasal epinephrine has similar effects on coronary perfusion pressure and resuscitation compared with standard dose iv epinephrine. therefore, the nasal route for administration of epinephrine appears to be an acceptable alternate method of drug delivery during cpr and compares favorably with standard iv therapy in the canine model. because of the obvious benefits to human patients, these observations suggest further investigation.",Comparison of intravenous and intranasal administration of epinephrine during CPR in a canine model.,epinephrine

patients were randomly assigned to an intravenous bolus (180 microgram/kg) and 72 hour infusion of eptifibatide (2.0 microgram/kg per minute, n=48) or placebo (n=50). we assessed correlations of plasma eptifibatide levels with receptor occupancy and inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation at 5 minutes and 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours during treatment and 4 and 8 hours after termination of infusion. blood was collected in buffered citrate and d phenylalanyl l prolyl l arginine chloromethylketone anticoagulants. although eptifibatide produced profound, prolonged inhibition of platelet aggregation during therapy, aggregation appeared to recover partially by 4 hours after the bolus. the aggregation response was greater with thrombin receptor agonist peptide versus adp stimulation; inhibition of platelet aggregation was greater in blood samples anticoagulated with citrate versus d phenylalanyl l prolyl l arginine chloromethylketone (ppack). plasma eptifibatide levels correlated significantly with receptor occupancy but not with inhibition of platelet aggregation.
a bolus and infusion of eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation profoundly in patients with acs and is followed by brief, partial recovery. these results enhance our understanding of the relation between pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of eptifibatide in such patients and may have important implications for its use in percutaneous interventions.",Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide in patients with acute coronary syndromes: prospective analysis from PURSUIT.,eptifibatide

[],31258066,"animal studies on cardiac arrest found that a combination of epinephrine with esmolol attenuates post resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. based on these findings, we hypothesized that esmololepinephrine combination therapy would be superior to a reported cardioprotective esmolol therapy alone in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (ir) injury.
c57bl/6j mice were subjected to 60 min of myocardial ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. mice received either saline, esmolol (0.4 mg/kg/h), epinephrine (0.05 mg/kg/h), or esmolol combined with epinephrine (esmolol: 0.4 mg/kg/h or 0.8 mg/kg/h and epinephrine: 0.05 mg/kg/h) during reperfusion. after reperfusion, infarct sizes in the area at risk and serum cardiac troponin i levels were determined. hemodynamic effects of drugs infused were determined by measurements of heart rate (hr) and mean arterial blood pressure (map) via a carotid artery catheter.
esmolol during reperfusion resulted in robust cardioprotection (esmolol vs. saline: 24.3±8% vs. 40.6±3% infarct size), which was abolished by epinephrine co administration (38.1±15% infarct size). increasing the esmolol dose, however, was able to restore esmolol cardioprotection in the epinephrine esmolol (18.6±8% infarct size) co treatment group with improved hemodynamics compared to the esmolol group (epinephrine esmolol vs. esmolol: map 80 vs. 75 mmhg, hr 452 vs. 402 beats/min).
these results confirm earlier studies on esmolol cardioprotection from myocardial ir injury and demonstrate that a dose optimized epinephrine esmolol co treatment maintains esmolol cardioprotection with improved hemodynamics compared to esmolol treatment alone. these findings might have implications for current clinical practice in hemodynamically unstable patients suffering from myocardial ischemia.",Dose-dependent Effects of Esmolol-epinephrine Combination Therapy in Myocardial Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury.,esmolol

compared to the baseline, ldl c was reduced by 19.2% (p<0.001) after ezetimibe monotherapy and by 24.7% (p<0.001) after co administration with ezetimibe and any statin. ezetimibe therapy decreased cholesterol absorption markers and increased a cholesterol synthesis marker. treatment with ezetimibe reduced the fasting serum insulin level (p<0.05) and hba1c (p<0.05), increased serum adiponectin (p<0.01), and showed a significant decrease of high sensitive c reactive protein (hscrp, p<0.01). no adverse events occurred during the study.
thus, cholesterol absorption inhibition by ezetimibe is an important therapeutic strategy since ldl c and cholesterol absorption markers had a positive correlation. ezetimibe not only reduced the serum ldl c level but also improved glucose metabolism as well as obesity and inflammation markers. these findings support the benefit of ezetimibe as a new option for the treatment of dyslipidemia.",The effects of ezetimibe on surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia.,ezetimibe

uuo was induced surgically in mice, followed by either no treatment with fimasartan or the intraperitoneal administration of fimasartan (3 mg/kg/day). on day 7, we evaluated the changes in the renin angiotensin system (ras) and the expression of nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes, as well as renal inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys. the effect of fimasartan on the nrf2 pathway was also investigated in hk 2 cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor α.
the mice with surgically induced uuo showed increased renal inflammation and fibrosis as evidenced by histopathologic findings and total collagen content in the kidney. these effects were attenuated in the obstructed kidneys of the fimasartan treated mice. fimasartan treatment inhibited ras activation and the expression of nox1, nox2, and nox4. in contrast, fimasartan upregulated the renal expression of nrf2 and its downstream signaling molecules (such as nqo1; ho 1; gsta2 and gstm3). furthermore, it increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including cusod, mnsod, and catalase. the fimasartan treated mice had significantly less apoptosis on tunel staining, with decreased levels of pro apoptotic protein and increased levels of anti apoptotic protein. in the hk 2 cells, fimasartan treatment inhibited ras activation, decreased expression of mitogen activated protein kinases (mapks), and upregulated the nrf2 pathway.
these results suggest that fimasartan has beneficial effects in reducing renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. possible mechanisms to explain these effects are inhibition of ras and mapks and upregulation of nrf2 signaling, with subsequent induction of antioxidant pathways.","Fimasartan, a Novel Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker, Protects against Renal Inflammation and Fibrosis in Mice with Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction: the Possible Role of Nrf2.",fimasartan

1) flecainide treatment prolonged hv and va intervals, and the addition of isoproterenol did not affect these variables. 2) isoproterenol shortened anterograde and retrograde block cycle length and the refractory period of the accessory pathway and the av node. it also decreased the tachycardia cycle length, an effect that was due solely to shortening of av node conduction time. 3) flecainide treatment prevented tachycardia induction by affecting retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. isoproterenol allowed for tachycardia induction and for more sustained episodes of tachycardia by reversing the effect of flecainide on retrograde accessory pathway conduction. 4) tachycardia recurred during follow up in all three patients in whom tachycardia of greater than or equal to 10 s duration was induced after isoproterenol but in no patient who had no or shorter episodes of induced tachycardia (and who did not have a change in medical regimen).
1) isoproterenol reverses flecainide induced prolongation of block cycle length and refractory periods of the accessory pathway and av node. 2) isoproterenol reverses flecainide induced prevention of tachycardia induction through reversal of the effects of flecainide on the retrograde accessory pathway. 3) the addition of isoproterenol during flecainide restudy is valuable in predicting long term drug efficacy.",Electrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia treated with flecainide.,flecainide

furosemide alone produced natriuresis/diuresis and a prompt rise in plasma aldosterone values. nesiritide alone produced no significant natriuresis/diuresis, but decreased plasma aldosterone values. when furosemide was administered on a background of nesiritide infusion, the observed natriuresis/diuresis was similar to that seen with furosemide alone, without the anticipated increase in plasma aldosterone observed with furosemide alone.","Natriuretic and neurohormonal responses to nesiritide, furosemide, and combined nesiritide and furosemide in patients with stable systolic dysfunction.",furosemide

contractile responses to kci (15 90 mm) and phenylephrine (10( 9) 10( 4) m) were recorded. both vascular reactivity and sensitivity were significantly reduced in portal vein ligation rats as compared to sham rats. chronic isosorbide dinitrate treatment reduced portal venous pressure in portal vein ligation rats. moreover, the maximal contractile responses to kcl and phenylephrine were significantly enhanced in both portal vein ligation and sham rats after isosorbide dinitrate treatment, but relative hyporeactivity persisted in portal vein ligation rats. in contrast, a single dose of isosorbide dinitrate did not alter the contractile sensitivity or reactivity to kcl or phenylephrine in either portal vein ligation or sham rats.

the higher labetalol concentration in women than in men was explained largely by differences in inactive and alpha1 blocking stereoisomers. however, concentrations were similar between genders for the beta blocking stereoisomer (r,r labetalol), possibly explaining the similarity in antihypertensive response to the drug. this study highlights the importance of determining stereoisomer kinetics for agents administered as racemates, particularly when relating concentrations to pharmacologic response.",Gender differences in labetalol kinetics: importance of determining stereoisomer kinetics for racemic drugs.,labetalol

an observational study of symptoms, 12 lead ecgs, and serum lidocaine levels were obtained following the administration of either 15 mg/kg lidocaine or 35 mg/kg lidocaine in the perivenous saphenous space under ultrasound guidance. blood was drawn at regular intervals in heparinized tubes and spun at 3000 r/min for 10 min. the plasma lidocaine levels were plotted vs. time for statistical comparisons.
with the 35 mg/kg dose, four of 11 participants developed symptoms of lidocaine toxicity at 40 min, which resolved by 180 min. the 35 mg/kg dose resulted in a mean serum lidocaine peak of 2.55 µg/ml at 60 min. the 15 mg/kg dose did not result in any symptoms of lidocaine toxicity, and it resulted in a serum lidocaine plateau of 0.85 µg/ml at 180 min. no significant changes were seen on the 12 lead ecg after the administration of lidocaine at either dose.

arginine vasopressin (avp) functions in the regulation of plasma osmolarity and blood pressure. in heart failure, avp worsens heart failure by causing vasoconstriction of arteries and veins, potentially contributing to remodeling of the left ventricle and causing fluid retention and worsening of hyponatremia. two v(2) receptor antagonists, tolvaptan and lixivaptan, and one combined v(1a)  and v(2) receptor antagonist, conivaptan, have shown promise for use in patients with heart failure. all three agents have been shown to increase free water excretion and increase serum sodium levels while maintaining serum potassium levels. they have not been shown to decrease renal function or the glomerular filtration rate and are well tolerated, with thirst being the major adverse effect during clinical trials. because of their effects on sodium, vasopressin antagonists need to be carefully monitored to ensure that serum sodium levels do not increase too quickly and put the patient at risk for overcorrection or osmotic demyelination syndrome. in addition, patients need to be monitored for signs of dehydration secondary to increased urine excretion. to date, studies have not consistently shown improvements in patient symptoms or weight reduction. however, early data suggest that at least one agent, tolvaptan, does not alter mortality.
based on data from available clinical trials, vasopressin antagonists may offer a new treatment option for patients with congestive heart failure. however, these agents do not currently appear to delay the progression of heart failure or decrease mortality.",Vasopressin-receptor antagonists in heart failure.,lixivaptan

of 76 patients who entered the run in period, 26 (12 men, 14 women; mean age, 56.2 years) were randomized to receive active treatment and 24 were included in the efficacy analysis; 13 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic substudy, 12 of whom had complete pharmacokinetic data. compared with lovastatin ir, lovastatin er produced a 3.9% greater reduction in ldl c (p = 0.044). changes in other lipid parameters were not statistically significant. in the pharmacokinetic substudy, c(max) values for lovastatin, lovastatin acid, and in hibitors of hmg coa reductase were lower at day 28 with lovastatin er than with lovastatin ir. the auc(0 24) ratio for lovastatin was 1.91 (90% ci, 1.77   3.35), reflecting higher bioavailability of the prodrug with lovastatin er; in contrast, the ratios for lovastatin acid and active and total inhibitors of hmg coa reductase were < 1.
in this short term study in a small number of patients, lovastatin er 40 mg produced significantly greater ldl c lowering than did an equal dose of lovastatin ir, with a relatively low c(max) and comparable systemic exposure to lovastatin acid and active and total inhibitors of hmg coa reductase. lovastatin er was well tolerated, with no discontinuations due to adverse events.","A multiple-dose pharmacodynamic, safety, and pharmacokinetic comparison of extended- and immediate-release formulations of lovastatin.",lovastatin

medulloblastoma cell lines were exposed in vitro to lovastatin with or without mevalonate, and document the effects using morphology, flow cytometry. dna electrophoresis and northern analysis.
1) mevalonate prevents apoptosis when co incubated with lovastatin, or when administered to lovastatin pretreated cells. 2) mevalonate restores the lovastatin arrested cell cycle, allowing s phase entry. 3) mevalonate does not prevent lovastatin induced apoptosis after a critical duration of lovastatin pretreatment. for cell lines daoy and uw228 this was 24 hours, and for d283 med and d341 med it was 48 hours. 4) increases in hmg coa reductase mrna levels induced by lovastatin are abrogated by co incubation with lovastatin and mevalonate.
these results confirm that lovastatin inhibition of this enzyme results in blockage of the mevalonate pathway, and that such a block is a critical step in the mechanism of lovastatin induced apoptosis.",Mevalonate prevents lovastatin-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines.,lovastatin

grapefruit juice greatly increased the serum concentrations of both lovastatin and lovastatin acid. the mean peak serum concentration (cmax) of lovastatin was increased about 12 fold (range, 5.2 fold to 19.7 fold; p < 0.001) and the area under the concentration time curve [auc(0 12)] was increased 15 fold (range, 5.7 fold to 26.3 fold; p < 0.001) by grapefruit juice. the mean cmax and auc(0 12) of lovastatin acid were increased about fourfold (range, 1.8 fold to 11.5 fold; p < 0.001) and fivefold (range, 2.4 fold to 23.3 fold; p < 0.001) by grapefruit juice, respectively. the half lives of lovastatin and lovastatin acid remained unchanged.
grapefruit juice can greatly increase serum concentrations of lovastatin and its active metabolite, lovastatin acid, probably by preventing cyp3a4 mediated first pass metabolism in the small intestine. the concomitant use of grapefruit juice with lovastatin and simvastatin should be avoided, or the dose of these 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.",Grapefruit juice greatly increases serum concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid.,lovastatin

in three experiments we investigated the anticonvulsant properties of magnesium sulfate on the hippocampus because of its high density of n methyl d aspartate receptors and link to clinical epilepsy. seizure activity was elicited in the hippocampus of rats or in in vitro hippocampal brain slices. the effects of magnesium on seizure activity were determined.
(1) intraperitoneal magnesium sulfate (270 or 360 mg/kg) failed to block hippocampal seizures but reduced electroencephalographic amplitude and seizure duration. (2) injection of magnesium sulfate directly into a seizure focus blocked seizures and elevated seizure thresholds. (3) low magnesium levels produced epileptiform activity in an in vitro hippocampal brain slice preparation; the epileptiform activity was reversed by increasing the magnesium concentration.

in order to investigate the effects of a selective pde3 inhibitor on insulin secretion, glucose and lipolysis levels and dose response relationship, varying doses of milrinone were injected into the right internal jugular vein in conscious rats, and blood glucose, plasma free fatty acid (ffa) and insulin levels were observed. the effects of milrinone on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were assessed by using a hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamping.
chronically catheterized nonstressed rats were administered varying doses of milrinone (1, 5, 25 micromol/kg) and were compared with controls not treated with milrinone. after dosing, plasma ffa levels in the 3 milrinone groups significantly increased compared with before dosing and the controls. the percentages of elevation of ffa by the different milrinone doses were very similar, 50%, 52%, 55% for 1, 5 and 25 micromol/kg, respectively, at 2 min after dosing, suggesting that lipolysis is very sensitive to the effect of milrinone. however, the effect of milrinone on glucose concentration was detectable only in 25 micromol/kg group, and the plasma insulin levels were significantly elevated in the 5 and 25 micromol/kg milrinone groups, indicating that there was a dose response relationship between milrinone and insulin and glucose levels. during hyperinsulinemic clamping, there were a significant increase in plasma ffa (173.1 +/  15.2 to 633.8 +/  87.3 microeq/l, p < 0.01) and a significant decrease in glucose infusion rates (gir) to about 21%, and a slight increase in plasma insulin after milrinone treatment.
these data suggest that milrinone impaired the abilities of insulin to suppress lipolysis and insulin mediated glucose utilization in peripheral tissue, despite having a slight increase in insulin secretion. therefore, we conclude that milrinone administration induces an acute insulin resistance in vivo, and that may limit the therapeutic value of milrinone for human diabetic subjects.",In vivo effects of phosphodiesterase III inhibitors on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.,milrinone

in the milrinone group, the total injury score was significantly lower relative to the control group (p = 0.001). caspase 3 staining was moderately strong in the control group but weaker in the milrinone group. apoptotic index was significantly lower in the milrinone group compared to the control group (p = 0.001). in comparison between groups, sod and gpx in the milrinone group was significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.008, p = 0.006).

to describe the stereoseletive nebivolol pharmacokinetics in cyp2d6 poor metabolizers (pm) and to assess whether the phenotype has an impact on nebivolol pharmacokinetics.
three healthy volunteers pm phenotyped (ratios of 20.1, 220 and 244 for the 8 h urinary excretion of metoprolol/alfa hydroxymetoprolol) received a single oral dose of racemic nebivolol and sequential blood samples were collected between zero (predose) and 48 h.
the obtained data were compared to 22 em subjects with normal kidney function enrolled in our previous study. for both isomers, cmax, tmax and auc0 48 were significantly greater in the pm group compared to the ems (p = 0.006   0.001). for d nebivolol, cmax, tmax and auc0 48 were, on average, 5.9, 2.7 and 15.0 larger in pms. the corresponding values for l nebivolol were 4.4, 2.7 and 17.5.
the decline in plasma concentration of both nebivolol isomers in pm phenotypes, especially those with mr of 220 and 244, which indicate minimal or absent cyp2d6 activity, points to alternative mechanisms for nebivolol elimination. collectively, our results are the first to show the significant impact of cyp2d6 pm phenotype on the metabolic disposition and in vivo exposure to both nebivolol isomers.",Effect of CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer Phenotype on Stereoselective Nebivolol Pharmacokinetics.,nebivolol

peak plasma levels after short acting and slow release nifedipine were achieved within 60 min and 330 min, respectively. short acting (10 mg, n = 10) and slow release (n = 10) nifedipine, but not placebo, markedly activated msa and increased plasma norepinephrine; plasma endothelin increased only with slow release nifedipine. hr increased after short acting nifedipine, but not after nifedipine gits. nifedipine had no effect on ssa (n = 6). blockade of cardiac sympathetic activity (with esmolol) led to similar decreases in hr with or without nifedipine, whereas parasympatholysis (with atropine) led to similar increases in hr with or without nifedipine. the cold pressor test markedly increased msa in all treatment groups and further increased msa beyond the increase induced by nifedipine.
nifedipine markedly increased msa, but not ssa, independently of drug release formulation. in contrast, hr increased with short acting, but not with slow release, nifedipine. therefore, nifedipine activates cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves differently depending on pharmacokinetics. these effects of nifedipine may be disadvantageous in cardiac patients with increased sympathetic activity or congestive heart failure, or both.",Differential activation of cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nervous system by nifedipine: role of pharmacokinetics.,nifedipine

seventeen patients with pph undergoing a nifedipine trial were assessed for hemodynamic response to inhaled no at 80 parts per million for 5 minutes. the nifedipine trial consisted of 20 mg of nifedipine hourly for 8 hours unless limited by hypotension or intolerable side effects. patients were classified as responders and nonresponders with positive response defined as > or =20% reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mpa) or pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) with the vasodilator administration.
no was safely administered to all participants. seven of 17 (41.2%) responded to no, and 8 of the 17 to nifedipine (47.1%). nifedipine was safely administered in 14 of the 17. three suffered either mild or severe hypotension, including one death. all no responders also responded to nifedipine, and 9 of the 10 no nonresponders were nifedipine nonresponders, representing a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 100%, and overall predictive accuracy of 94%. all no responders tolerated a full nifedipine trial without hypotension. there was a highly significant correlation between the effects of no and nifedipine on pvr (r=0.67, p=0.003).
the pulmonary vascular response to inhaled no accurately predicts the acute hemodynamic response to nifedipine in pph, and a positive response to no is associated with a safe nifedipine trial. in patients comparable with those evaluated, a trial of nifedipine in no nonresponders appears unwarranted and potentially dangerous.",Inhaled nitric oxide in primary pulmonary hypertension: a safe and effective agent for predicting response to nifedipine.,nifedipine

an oral dose of 50 mg/kg racemic oxprenolol was given to nine rabbits twice, in random sequence with and without the concurrent administration of probenecid. oxprenolol enantiomers were determined in plasma and urine by an enantioselective hplc method. oxprenolol glucuronides were measured in plasma and urine after enzymatic hydrolysis.
the disposition of the oxprenolol enantiomers in rabbits is stereoselective, mainly due to a difference in metabolism. renal excretion is only a minor elimination route for unchanged oxprenolol, and the renal clearances of the enantiomers are similar. pretreatment with probenecid did not affect the plasma concentrations of the oxprenolol enantiomers, but there was a slight decrease in their urinary excretion. the plasma concentrations of the oxprenolol glucuronides are much higher than those of the parent enantiomers, and those of (s) glucuronide are about twice those of its antipode. about 10% of the oxprenolol dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronides. the renal clearances of both glucuronides are similar, and markedly higher than the creatinine clearance. after probenecid, the mean glucuronide plasma levels were markedly higher, with for both glucuronides a more than twofold increase in mean auc. probenecid decreased the renal clearance of both glucuronides to about 30%. moreover, it decreased slightly the formation clearance of (s) glucuronide, while the formation clearance of (r) glucuronide was not significantly influenced.
our results show that in the rabbit, both oxprenolol glucuronide diastereomers are actively secreted by the kidney, and that this process is inhibited by probenecid.",Effect of probenecid on the enantioselective pharmacokinetics of oxprenolol and its glucuronides in the rabbit.,oxprenolol

after 6 months of treatment, systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly by perindopril (supine by 11%, sitting by 10%) and by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine by 8%, sitting by 12%). diastolic blood pressure was also decreased significantly by perindopril (supine by 8%, sitting by 11%) and by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (supine by 4%, sitting by 9%). mean arterial pressure decreased significantly during treatment with perindopril (by 9%) and with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 6%). cardiac index increased with perindopril (by 6%), because of an increased stroke index (by 5%), but amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide did not change cardiac function. systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly more with perindopril (by 14%) than with amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (by 8%). the distensibility of the common carotid artery was significantly enhanced by perindopril (by 16%), but not changed by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide (1% difference). the difference between perindopril and amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide for carotid distensibility was statistically significant. the compliance of the common carotid artery tended to be increased more by perindopril (by 7%) than by amiloride+hydrochlorothiazide, which induced a 5% decrease in carotid compliance. after withdrawal of therapy, for both drugs, all treatment induced changes were reversed to pretreatment values within 7 weeks.

aliskiren and perindopril reduced proteinuria. these effects were dose dependent. furthermore, 24 h proteinuria was reduced by 23% (mean 95% ci; 2–44) by treatment with aliskiren (150 mg), by 36% (95% ci, 17–55; p<0.001) with aliskiren (300 mg), by 7.1% (95% ci, 11–26) with perindopril (5 mg) and by 25% (95% ci, 11–39; p<0.05) with perindopril (10 mg), compared to placebo. no significant difference was found between the effects of aliskiren and perindopril.

pravastatin therapy is effective and safe when used in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients. although the pravastatin induced reduction in tc and ldl was more pronounced in patients receiving cyclosporine, the reduction was not statistically different from that in the tacrolimus group. no evidence of hepatic dysfunction or rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with pravastatin was noted. long term studies are required to evaluate the effect of pravastatin therapy on the incidence of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis in this population.",Safety and efficacy of pravastatin therapy for the prevention of hyperlipidemia in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients.,pravastatin

this was an open label, randomized, 3 way crossover trial consisting of three 7 day treatment periods. healthy male volunteers received one of the following treatment regimens in each period: rosuvastatin 10 mg orally once daily; fenofibrate 67 mg orally tid; and rosuvastatin + fenofibrate dosed as above. the steady state pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and fenofibric acid, both as substrate and as interacting drug, were investigated on day 7 of dosing. treatment effects were assessed by construction of 90% cis around the ratios of the geometric least square means for rosuvastatin + fenofibrate/rosuvastatin and rosuvastatin + fenofibrate/fenofibrate for the area under the plasma concentration time curve (auc) and maximum plasma concentration (derived from analysis of variance of log transformed parameters).
fourteen healthy male volunteers participated in the study. when rosuvastatin was coadministered with fenofibrate, there were minor increases in the auc from 0 to 24 hours and maximum concentration (cmax) of rosuvastatin: the respective geometric least square means increased by 7% (90% ci, 1.00 1.15) and 21% (90% ci, 1.14 1.28). the pharmacokinetic parameters of fenofibric acid were similar when fenofibrate was dosed alone and with rosuvastatin: the geometric least square means for fenofibric acid auc from 0 to 8 hours and cmax decreased by 4% (90% ci, 0.90 1.02) and 9% (90% ci, 0.84 1.00), respectively. the treatments were well tolerated alone and in combination.
coadministration of rosuvastatin and fenofibrate produced minimal changes in rosuvastatin and fenofibric acid exposure.","An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover trial of the effects of coadministration of rosuvastatin and fenofibrate on the pharmacokinetic properties of rosuvastatin and fenofibric acid in healthy male volunteers.",rosuvastatin

this study assessed the metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of radiolabeled rosuvastatin ([14c] rosuvastatin) in healthy volunteers.
this was a nonrandomized, open label, single day trial. healthy adult male volunteers were given a single oral dose of [14c] rosuvastatin 20 mg (20 ml [14c] rosuvastatin solution, nominally containing 50 microci radioactivity). blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected up to 10 days after dosing. tolerability assessments were made up to 10 days after dosing (trial completion) and at a follow up visit within 14 days of trial completion.
six white male volunteers aged 36 to 52 years (mean, 43.7 years) participated in the trial. the geometric mean peak plasma concentration (c(max)) of rosuvastatin was 6.06 ng/ml and was reached at a median of 5 hours after dosing. at c(max), rosuvastatin accounted for approximately 50% of the circulating radioactive material. approximately 90% of the rosuvastatin dose was recovered in feces, with the remainder recovered in urine. the majority of the dose (approximately 70%) was recovered within 72 hours after dosing; excretion was complete by 10 days after dosing. metabolite profiles in feces indicated that rosuvastatin was excreted largely unchanged (76.8% of the dose). two metabolites rosuvastatin 5s lactone and n desmethyl rosuvastatin were present in excreta. [14c] rosuvastatin was well tolerated; 2 volunteers reported 4 mild adverse events that resolved without treatment.
the majority of the rosuvastatin dose was excreted unchanged. given the absolute bioavailability (20%) and estimated absorption (approximately 50%) of rosuvastatin, this finding suggests that metabolism is a minor route of clearance for this agent.","Metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy adult male volunteers.",rosuvastatin

the metabolic pathways of sildenafil n demethylation were studied using human liver microsomes, as well as microsomes expressing individual human cyp enzymes. further studies to identify the individual enzymes were performed at 2.5 and 250 microm sildenafil, and employed a combination of chemical inhibition, correlation analysis, and metabolism by expressed recombinant cyp enzymes. in addition, the effect of sildenafil on the activity of the six major drug metabolizing enzymes was investigated.
sildenafil conversion was found to be mediated by at least two cyp enzymes, for which the mean kinetic parameters were km1 = 6(+/ 3 microm), km2 = 81(+/ 45 microm), vmax1 = 22(+/ 9 pmol) and vmax2 = 138(+/ 77 pmol) uk 103 320 formed min( 1) mg( 1). at 250 microm sildenafil, n demethylation was primarily mediated through the low affinity, high km enzyme (approximately 83%), whilst at 2.5 microm there was a greater role for the high affinity, low km enzyme (approximately 61%). ketoconazole strongly inhibited metabolism at both sildenafil concentrations and was the only significant inhibitor at 250 microm sildenafil. at the lower sildenafil concentration, sulphaphenazole and quinidine also inhibited formation of uk 103 320. overall, 75% or more of the n demethylation of sildenafil at any concentration is probably attributable to cyp3a4. these results were supported by experiments using expressed human cyp enzymes, in which only cyp3a4 and cyp2c9 exhibited substantial sildenafil n demethylase activity (respective km values of 221 microm and 27 microm). sildenafil metabolism was inhibited by potent cyp3a4 inhibitors which are used clinically, but was found to be only a weak inhibitor of drug metabolizing enzymes itself, the strongest inhibition occurring against cyp2c9 (ki = 80 microm).
evidence is provided for cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent cyp2c9 mediated metabolism of sildenafil. there is the possibility that elevated plasma concentrations of sildenafil could occur with coadministration of known inhibitors of cyp2c9 or cyp3a4. since peak plasma concentrations of clinical doses of sildenafil are only 200 ng ml( 1) ( approximately 0.4 microm) it is very unlikely that sildenafil will significantly alter the plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzymes.",Identification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the N-demethylation of sildenafil.,sildenafil

[],22241944,"ticagrelor is a novel p2y₁₂ receptor antagonist which, like clopidogrel and prasugrel, functions by blocking adenosine diphosphate mediated platelet aggregation. however, unlike the aforementioned agents, the binding of ticagrelor to this receptor is reversible. ticagrelor is also believed to mediate some of its beneficial effects by augmenting the effects of adenosine, which is another unique pharmacologic property of this drug. in terms of antiplatelet effect, ticagrelor is more potent than clopidogrel and produces a faster and stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation. this may also be an advantage of ticagrelor over prasugrel, but this has not been adequately studied. due to the reversible nature of the binding of ticagrelor to the platelet receptor, ticagrelor has a relatively fast offset of effect, with platelet aggregation approaching pretreatment levels about 3 days after discontinuation of therapy. this has advantages in patients requiring invasive procedures, but also makes medication adherence very important in order to be able to maintain an effective antiplatelet effect. ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel when given to patients with an acute coronary syndrome, resulting in significantly lower rates of myocardial infarction and vascular death. however, ticagrelor is indicated to be administered with aspirin, and the clinical benefits of ticagrelor may be less when daily dosages of aspirin exceed 100 mg. as expected, bleeding is the most common adverse effect with ticagrelor, although it occurs at rates comparable with those seen for clopidogrel with the exception of noncoronary artery bypass graft related major bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeds, the latter of which occurs only rarely. dyspnea is another common adverse effect with ticagrelor, although this is usually not severe and resolves with drug discontinuation. unlike clopidogrel, there are no known pharmacogenomic concerns with ticagrelor, and emerging data suggest ticagrelor to be effective in patients resistant to clopidogrel, although more study is needed on this topic. while preliminary data suggest ticagrelor to be cost effective when compared with generic clopidogrel, the acquisition cost of ticagrelor is not insignificant and this will likely be an issue for many health care organizations. currently, ticagrelor is well positioned to assume an active role in the treatment of coronary artery disease due to an impressive efficacy profile and reasonable safety. its ultimate role in therapy will continue to evolve as studies on this drug continue eg, (prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with prior heart attack using ticagrelor compared to placebo on a background of aspirin, pegasus) and more information hopefully becomes available on its use in clopidogrel nonresponders and relative safety and efficacy compared with prasugrel.",Critical appraisal of ticagrelor in the management of acute coronary syndrome.,ticagrelor

timolol gs (timoptic xe): plasma concentrations of timolol rarely exceeded 0.375 ng/ml (the lower limit of assay quantification). for all subjects, peak plasma concentrations of timolol averaged <0.3 ng/ml within 4 hours after the last dose. the highest single observation was 0.49 ng/ml in one subject (at hour 2). timolol solution: for all subjects, peak plasma concentrations of timolol averaged about 0.5 ng/ml and 0.3 ng/ml within 4 hours following the first and second dose, respectively, on day 8. the highest single observation was 0.95 ng/ml in one subject (at hour 2).

forty six patients were randomized in two groups to receive torsemide 20 mg/day (n = 22) or frusemide 40 mg/day (n = 24). both drugs were administered in association with spironolactone 200 mg/day. the initial doses of diuretics were increased every 3 days up to 60, 120 and 400 mg/day, respectively, if the body weight loss was less than 300 g/day or natriuresis was below 50 meq/day.
torsemide induced a significantly greater diuretic response than frusemide at 24 h and the maximum diuresis while mean diuresis was similar in both groups. natriuresis was also higher with torsemide but the difference was not significant. the body weight loss, the treatment period, the ascites resolution and complications were similar in both groups. diuretic doses were increased in two patients treated with torsemide and in nine patients treated with frusemide (p < 0.05).

randomised and quasi randomised studies comparing triflusal with placebo or aspirin in people at high risk of vascular events.
two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. the primary outcome was a serious vascular event (non fatal acute myocardial infarction (ami), non fatal ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or vascular death). other efficacy and safety measures collected were frequency of different vascular events, adverse events, minor and major hemorrhages.
(1) aspirin versus triflusal: five studies enrolled patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (tia) (4 trials; 2944 patients; followed for 6 to 47 months) or ami (one trial; 2275 patients; followed for 35 days). entry criteria were similar within each subgroup of patients. patient groups were appropriately selected and well matched. the primary outcome in all trials was a composite outcome of vascular events. trials had no important bias except in one study (217 patients). for the primary outcome of a serious vascular event there was no significant difference between triflusal and aspirin; the odds ratio (or) was 1.04 (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.87 to 1.23). significant differences were found for frequency of hemorrhages, both minor (or 1.60, 95% ci 1.31 to 1.95) and major (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.58 to 3.46) and for non hemorrhagic gastrointestinal adverse events (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.75 to 0.95). sensitivity analysis of well versus poorly allocated trials showed no significant differences. (2) triflusal versus placebo: two trials enrolled patients with unstable angina (281 patients) or peripheral arteriopathy (122 patients), who were followed for 6 months. triflusal was associated with a reduction in serious vascular events (or 2.29, 95% ci 1.01 to 5.19; or greater than 1 favours triflusal) and with a higher frequency of adverse events (or 1.68, 95% ci 1.00 to 2.80).

oral treatment of healthy volunteers with triflusal stimulated no production and enos protein expression in their neutrophils. after triflusal treatment, the neutrophils demonstrated a higher ability to prevent adp induced platelet aggregation. however, the neutrophils and the endogenous no generated by them failed to modify p selectin expression in adp activated platelets.","A 4-trifluoromethyl derivative of salicylate, triflusal, stimulates nitric oxide production by human neutrophils: role in platelet function.",triflusal

plasma concentrations of valsartan and cimetidine, measured by means of high performance liquid chromatography, were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. the rate of absorption of valsartan and the fraction of the dose absorbed and systemically available after oral administration were calculated using data from an i.v. study with valsartan in healthy young volunteers.
the pharmacokinetics of cimetidine area under curve (auc0 48 h), maximum concentration (cmax), time to reach cmax(tmax) and apparent terminal plasma half life (t1/2) was not changed by co administration of valsartan. for valsartan, the auc0 48 h increased by 7% and the cmax by 51% (ratio of geometric means) with co administration of cimetidine. the higher value for cmax was attributed to the initial increase in the rate of absorption of valsartan: ka was increased 2.7 fold and another indicator for the rate of absorption, cmax/tmax, 2.2 fold. this effect was ascribed to inhibition of acid secretion by cimetidine, which leads to a higher gastric ph, thereby increasing the solubility of valsartan; the t1/2 of valsartan was not changed. after valsartan alone, 19% of the dose was absorbed, 23% with co administration of cimetidine. it was estimated that only 2.2% of the possible change in auc might be missed by giving a single high dose of cimetidine instead of multiple doses, with the aim to optimally inhibit formation of the inactive metabolite of valsartan. cimetidine related changes in the rate of elimination of valsartan were not anticipated, since the clearance from plasma occurs mainly by biliary excretion of unchanged valsartan; metabolism and renal excretion are only minor contributors. therefore, even in the clinically relevant situation with multiple doses of valsartan and cimetidine, notable changes in the pharmacokinetics of valsartan, except for an increase in cmax, are not to be expected. this increase in cmax appears to be of no clinical significance. valsartan alone and in combination with cimetidine was well tolerated by healthy subjects.",An interaction study with cimetidine and the new angiotensin II antagonist valsartan.,valsartan
