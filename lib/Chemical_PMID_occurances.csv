[],31368101,"coronary spasm plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease, including angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction (ami), silent myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. the prevalence of coronary spasm is higher among east asians probably due to genetic as well as environmental factors. aldh2 eliminates toxic aldehydes including 4 hydroxy 2 nonenal (4 hne) derived from lipid peroxidation and acrolein in tobacco smoking as well as ethanol derived acetaldehyde and thereby protects tissues and cells from oxidative damage. deficient variant aldh2*2 genotype is prevalent among east asians and is a significant risk factor for both coronary spasm and ami through accumulation of toxic aldehydes, thereby contributing to oxidative stress, endothelial damage, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis. toxic aldehydes are thus identified as risk factors to be targeted for the treatment of coronary spasm and ami.",Association of East Asian Variant Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Genotype (ALDH2*2*) with Coronary Spasm and Acute Myocardial Infarction.,4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)

treatment with 50µm cr(vi) enhances forward movement of electrons through fadh2 respiratory chain and leaking through the ubiquinone binding site of complex iii. moreover, the protective effect of gsh on liver mitochondria electron leakage is through removing excess h2o2 and reducing total ros.",Effect of hexavalent chromium on electron leakage of respiratory chain in mitochondria isolated from rat liver.,FADH2

rats were fed diets supplemented with psh (1, 10, or 100 mg/kg/d) for 3 d. the rats were then subjected to 30 min ischemia through ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 3 h reperfusion through release of the ligation. the hearts were harvested and cut into four slices. to assess infarct size (is), an index representing heart damage, the slices were stained with 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride (ttc). to elucidate underlying mechanisms, western blotting was performed for the slices.

firstly, lncrna expression profiling of gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cancer cells was performed to identify lncrnas related to chemoresistance by microarray analysis. secondly, with insights into the mechanism of cerna, we used a bioinformatics approach to construct a chemoresistance related lncrnas associated cerna network. we then identified the topological key lncrnas in the cerna network and demonstrated its function or mechanism in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer using molecular biological methods. further studies evaluated its expression to assess its potential association with survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.
firstly, we demonstrated that lncrnas were dysregulated in gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cancer cells. we then constructed a chemoresistance related lncrna associated cerna network and proposed that lncrna homo sapiens glutathione s transferase mu 3, transcript variant 2 and noncoding rna (gstm3tv2; ncbi reference sequence: nr_024537.1) might act as a key cerna to enhance chemoresistance by upregulating l type amino acid transporter 2 (lat2) and oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1(olr1) in pancreatic cancer. further studies demonstrated that gstm3tv2, overexpressed in gemcitabine resistant cells, enhanced the gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. mechanistically, we identified that gstm3tv2 upregulated lat2 and olr1 by competitively sponging let 7 to promote gemcitabine resistance. in addition, we revealed that the expression levels of gstm3tv2 were significantly increased in pancreatic cancer tissues and were associated with poor prognosis.

aberrant crypt foci showed positive immunostaining for glutathione s transferase p1 1 but negative staining for cyclooxygenase 2. the percentage of apoptotic cells in aberrant crypt foci was significantly lower than in healthy epithelium, and the difference became more apparent with deoxycholic acid treatment. the impaired sensitivity of aberrant crypt foci to deoxycholic acid was restored by the glutathione s transferase p1 1 specific inhibitor gamma glutamyl s (benzyl)cysteinyl r phenylglycine diethylester. by transfection of glutathione s transferase p1 1, m7609 cells became more resistant to deoxycholic acid induced apoptosis than mock transfectants. direct binding of glutathione s transferase p1 1 to deoxycholic acid was proven by circular dichroism and by immunoprecipitation. the aberrant crypt foci in adenoma patients treated with sulindac, which was shown to bind to glutathione s transferase p1 1, underwent apoptosis in 4 days and mostly regressed in 2 3 months.

while the subjects aspirated air at a constant flow, there was a slow rise to a first nitric oxide plateau. on opening to the analyzer after the accumulation period, the peak nitric oxide level was several times higher than the initial plateau (range, 2810 19008 ppb) and then slowly returned to previous plateau levels. there was no significant difference between initial and second plateau nitric oxide levels for any period. the accumulated nitric oxide peak increased in direct proportion to the accumulation time (p<.001).

placental tissues from 11 normal and 11 preeclamptic women were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after delivery. one gram of tissue from each placenta was homogenized for analysis. placental tissues were also obtained from six normal pregnancies for incubation with a glutathione peroxidase inhibitor, n ethylmaleimide. samples were analyzed for glutathione peroxidase activity, lipid peroxides by hydrogen peroxide equivalents, thromboxane by thromboxane b2, and prostacyclin by 6 keto prostaglandin f1 alpha.

glutathione peroxidase activity is significantly lower, and lipid peroxides and thromboxane are significantly higher, in preeclamptic placentas compared with normal placentas. inhibition of glutathione peroxidase activity in normal placentas results in significantly increased production of lipid peroxides and thromboxane and an increase in the thromboxane to prostacyclin ratio. we speculate that in normal placentas, glutathione peroxidase limits prostaglandin h synthase activity by reducing the amount of peroxide present, thus reducing peroxide stimulation of prostaglandin h synthase. in preeclampsia deficient glutathione peroxidase activity results in in increased peroxide levels leading to increased stimulation of prostaglandin h synthase, which results in increased production of lipid peroxides and thromboxane.",Deficient glutathione peroxidase activity in preeclampsia is associated with increased placental production of thromboxane and lipid peroxides.,Peroxides

we aimed at evaluation of serum rbp level in patients with recalcitrant cutaneous warts in order to assess its correlation with disease pathogenesis.
serum rbp level was measured by an elisa technique in 50 patients with recalcitrant cutaneous warts and 30 apparently healthy controls.
serum rbp level was significantly lower in patients with recalcitrant warts than the control group (p < 0.001). however, it did not differ regarding different clinical parameters in studied patients (p > 0.05 each). rbp is a reliable biomarker for significant early detection and discrimination between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001) at a cutoff value ≤1034.6 μg/ml, with sensitivity and specificity (100% each).

the mass spectrometry data supported earlier work in which high performance liquid chromatography, uv visible spectrometry and chemical modification showed that the macular pigment comprises two carotenoids with identical properties to those of zeaxanthin and lutein. chiral column chromatography showed that the ""zeaxanthin"" fraction is a mixture of two stereoisomers, zeaxanthin itself [(3r,3'r) beta,beta carotene 3,3' diol] and meso zeaxanthin [(3r,3's) beta,beta carotene 3,3' diol]. the other fraction is the single stereoisomer, lutein [(3r,3'r,6'r) beta,epsilon carotene 3,3' diol]. in human blood plasma, only zeaxanthin and lutein were found.
the results strongly suggest that meso zeaxanthin results from chemical processes within the retina. noting that lutein exceeds zeaxanthin in plasma but that the combined zeaxanthin stereoisomers exceed lutein in the retina, the possibility was considered that meso zeaxanthin is a conversion product derived from retinal lutein. under nonphysiologic conditions, the authors demonstrate that a base catalyzed conversion of lutein to zeaxanthin yields only the meso (3r,3's) stereoisomer.",Stereochemistry of the human macular carotenoids.,zeaxanthin
